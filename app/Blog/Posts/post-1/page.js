            Understanding Sperm Morphology and Its Vital Role in Bull Fertility
            Assessments
          </h1>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>
            Over the years, I’ve had many conversations with cattle producers
            about bull fertility, and two comments often stand out. One producer
            might say, “I’m putting one bull with a group of cows, and they’re
            getting pregnant and having calves,” confident that this means the
            bull is fertile. Another might share, “A late calf is better than no
            calf,” reflecting the belief that any calf born is a success.
          </p>

          <p>
            These perspectives are understandable—after all, if calves are being
            born, it’s easy to assume everything is going well. But there’s more
            to fertility than simply if a bull produces calves. Fertility exists
            on a spectrum. At one end, a bull may produce no calves at all. On
            the other hand, a highly fertile bull achieves an 85% pregnancy rate
            in the first estrus cycle. In between, fertility can vary greatly,
            with conception rates of 20%, 30%, 50%, or 70%, you get the idea.
          </p>

          <p>
            The difference between good and great fertility matters. Bulls with
            higher conception rates produce more calves earlier in the season.
            This leads to shorter calving periods, heavier calves at weaning,
            and a more efficient and profitable herd overall.
          </p>

          <p>
            At the center of this spectrum is sperm morphology—the structure and
            shape of a bull’s sperm. Morphology is a key predictor of fertility,
            influencing how quickly cows conceive and how many calves are born
            early. In this article, we’ll explore the importance of sperm
            morphology, how it’s assessed, and how it can improve your herd’s
            reproductive efficiency. Whether you’re looking to maximize calving
            season success or simply better understand your bull’s potential,
            you’ll find valuable insights here.{" "}

          <h2>What Is Sperm Morphology?</h2>

          <p>
            Sperm morphology evaluates the physical structure of sperm cells.
            This includes assessing the head, midpiece, and tail to identify
            abnormalities and defects that impact the sperm's ability to
            fertilize an egg. Morphologically normal sperm structure is
            essential to fertilize the oocyte (egg). Sperm must find their way
            traversing through the female reproductive tract, locate the oocyte,
            then create a hole through the oocyte’s cell wall to penetrate and
            deposit the sires DNA where is combines with the dams and initiates
            embryonic development. While only one gets in it literally is a team
            effort to accomplish this task. Abnormalities, such as bent or
            coiled tails, malformed or heads with holes in them, and swollen or
            misshaped midpieces can hinder mobility or the sperm’s capacity to
            bind and penetrate an oocyte.

          <h2>
            Why Is Sperm Morphology Crucial in Bull Breeding Soundness Exam?
          </h2>

          <p>
            A bull breeding soundness exam (BBSE) includes physical examination,
            scrotal circumference measurement, sperm motility analysis, and
            sperm morphology evaluation. Among these, sperm morphology is
            strongly correlated with fertility outcomes like conception rates,
            time to conception, and calf output. ​(1)​ Research consistently
            demonstrates that bulls with a higher percentage of morphologically
            normal sperm are more likely to sire calves earlier in the breeding
            season, boosting herd efficiency.
          </p>

          <div className={styles.unorderedListDiv}>
            <p>For example:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Bulls with ≥70% normal sperm morphology are considered
                satisfactory potential breeders by the Society for
                Theriogenology. ​(2)​​{" "}
              </li>
              <li>
                Bulls with ≥80% normal morphology have been shown to achieve
                higher early conception rates. ​(3)​{" "}
              </li>
              <li>
                Bulls with 50-69% normal morphology may still be used under
                certain conditions but carry increased fertility risks. ​(4)​
              </li>
              <li>
                Bulls with less than 50% normal morphology are generally
                unsuitable for breeding. ​(4)​
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <p>
            Notably, fertility declines significantly when uncompensable
            abnormalities—defects that cannot be mitigated by increasing sperm
            numbers—exceed 20% of the sample. ​(5)

          <h2>A Nuanced Approach: Beyond Pass/Fail Classifications</h2>

          <p>
            Traditionally, BBSE results have been viewed through a binary
            “pass/fail” lens. From the exam bulls are classified as a
            “satisfactory potential breeder” or unsatisfactory with the ability
            to differ classification and recheck later. However, sperm
            morphology results treated as part of a broader risk assessment can
            in many cases add significant value and understanding of the bull’s
            fertility and management implications. For instance, a bull with
            borderline morphology might still be a viable breeder in herds with
            lower reproductive pressures but represents a risk in operations
            dependent on tight calving windows, single bull pastures, or use for
            artificial insemination. It is likely that the binary BBSE
            classification creates the idea of a pass/fail even though that is
            not its intent. Without a deeper understanding it is easy to
            interpret the results as a simple classification of the bull being
            good or bad, thus fertile or not fertile. We should be understanding
            bull fertility as a level of subfertility. Consider how we are using
            EPDs, like how we understand and use other bull traits such as
            growth. We may not select a bull that has the highest average daily
            gain, but we are sure not to choose one that brings our herd down
            and we will strive to achieve higher daily gains while considering
            other needs. We also know the value of EPDs to help in our
            selections process and we know that results are also dependent on
            many other environmental and management factors.{" "}

          <h2>What Does a Sperm Morphology Assessment Look Like?</h2>

            <ol>
              <li>
                Semen Collection: Typically performed via electroejaculation,
                rectal message and artificial vaginas may also be used.
              </li>
              <li>
                Slide Preparation: Sperm samples are stained, or a wet mount
                with a cover slip is used and prepared for microscopic
                evaluation. Proper handling is crucial to avoid introducing
                artifacts that could distort results. Slides must be prepared to
                have a single layer where the full sperm can be observed and not
                stacked on top of each other.
              </li>
              <li>
                Microscopic Evaluation: Using high magnification (1000X), a
                trained veterinarian examines at least 100 sperm cells per
                sample, focusing on head, midpiece, and tail defects.{" "}
              </li>
              <li>
                Classification of Abnormalities: There are various ways to
                classify sperm defects. Because there is not one classification
                system that can be used to gain a full understanding for both
                the potential fertility, causes, and prognosis, it is best to
                perform a differential count where each specific abnormality is
                counted and recorded. This takes additional effort, but the
                information obtained is well worth it.

          <h2>The Role of Genetics and Heritability in Sperm Morphology</h2>

          <p>
            Bull semen traits, including sperm morphology, are influenced by
            both genetics and environmental factors. Research shows that quality
            semen traits have low to moderate heritability with some defects
            being highly heritable. This indicates that selective breeding can
            improve sperm quality over time. ​(6)​ For instance:{" "}
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Proximal droplet defects are moderately heritable, shown to be as
              high as 0.37. ​(7)​
            </li>
            <li>
              Genetic correlations between scrotal circumference (a proxy for
              sperm production) and morphology traits are generally favorable.
              ​(6)​
            </li>
            <li>
              Bulls must also be bred to be adaptable for the environment in
              which they are used. Poorly adapted bulls commonly will have more
              sperm defects due to the stresses of the environment. ​(8)​

            Management and Environmental Factors Influencing Sperm Morphology
          </h2>

          <p>
            While genetics play a significant role, environmental and management
            factors also heavily influence sperm morphology. Stress, heat,
            disease, and nutrition are critical elements:
          </p>

          <div className={styles.orderedListDiv}>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Temperature Stress: Bulls exposed to high ambient temperatures
                can suffer heat stress, which reduces semen quality by causing
                defects like diadem vacuoles and abnormal heads. Providing
                shade, ventilation, and access to cool water can mitigate these
                effects. ​(8)
              </li>
              <li>
                Nutritional Deficiencies: Inadequate nutrition, particularly
                during pre-pubertal and post-pubertal growth phases, can impair
                testicular development and sperm production. ​(9)​
              </li>
              <li>
                Seasonal Variations: Seasonal changes can impact sperm
                morphology, with lower quality observed during extreme weather
                conditions. In northern regions more sperm defects are observed
                during the winter and late summer, where fewer are found during
                May and June. ​(10)​
              </li>
              <li>
                Health Management: Conditions such as subacute ruminal acidosis
                or systemic infections can negatively affect sperm quality.
                Regular health checks and proactive disease prevention are
                essential. ​(11)​
              </li>
              <li>
                Bull Handling and Housing: Proper handling to minimize stress
                and ensuring adequate space to prevent injuries or competition
                are key management practices. ​(12)​

            <li>
              Motility and Movement: Defects in the tail or midpiece can hinder
              the sperm’s ability to move effectively toward the oocyte.
            </li>
            <li>
              Fertilization Capability: Abnormalities of the acrosome including
              knobbed and ruffled acrosomes can reduce the sperm’s ability to
              bind and penetrate the oocyte.
            </li>
            <li>
              Sustaining Embryo Development: Even if fertilization occurs,
              structural defects in the sperm may compromise DNA integrity,
              which is critical for proper embryo development and subsequent
              pregnancy success.

          <h2>The Economic Implications</h2>

          <p>
            Herd reproductive efficiency is five times more important than
            growth and 10 times more important than carcass merit for a
            profitable and sustainable business operation. ​(13)​ Investing in
            detailed sperm morphology assessments can yield significant economic
            benefits for cattle producers. Bulls with higher fertility sire more
            calves earlier in the season, leading to more uniform calf crops and
            reducing the costs associated with prolonged calving intervals.

          <h2>Conclusion – Quality Semen Assessments </h2>

          <p>
            Sperm morphology is a powerful predictor of fertility that should be
            an integral part of any BBSE. By moving beyond pass/fail
            classifications and adopting a risk-based approach, cattle producers
            can make more informed decisions to optimize reproductive outcomes.
            The Society for Theriogenology 70% or greater normal morphology is
            well established for use to determine the potential for satisfactory
            results but the use of a quality morphology evaluation while
            understanding the producers needs creates an approach to better
            manage the use of bulls that may be borderline and improve herd
            fertility today and in the future.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, not all sperm morphology assessments are created equal.
            Alarmingly, studies indicate that a high percentage of veterinary
            respondents seldom identify common defects during morphology
            evaluations. ​(14)​ This raises concerns about the reliability and
            thoroughness of some assessments. While sperm morphology is a strong
            predictor of fertility there continues to be other unknown
            influences which can decrease a bull’s breeding success. In future
            blogs, we will explore what constitutes a high-quality morphology
            assessment, the risks of cursory evaluations, and how producers can
            ensure their bulls are evaluated with precision and accuracy.
