      <h1>Principal Piece (Tail) Abnormalities</h1>

      <p>
        The principal piece is the tail section of the sperm, and abnormalities
        here can severely restrict the sperm's motility, making it difficult to
        reach the egg.

          <div className={styles.abButton}>
            <p>
              A tightly coiled tail, which prevents normal forward movement and
              significantly reduces the sperm’s motility​​.

        <h2>Double Tail</h2>

        <p>
          Sperm with two tails two heads or accessory tail, often resulting in
          inefficient motility. This defect is rare but can severely affect
          sperm function​​.
        </p>

        <h2>Folded Tail</h2>

        <p>
          The tail is folded or bent, which limits the sperm’s ability to swim
          properly and reduces the chance of fertilization​.
        </p>

        <h2>Short Tail</h2>

        <p>
          Short Tail: An abnormally short tail that reduces motility and the
          ability of the sperm to reach the egg​​.
        </p>

        <h2>Distal Reflex</h2>

        <p>
          {" "}
          A sharp bend at the distal end of the tail, often linked to handling
          or environmental stress, which can impede sperm motility​.
